# gomodlayers

This will take a list of go.mod files as trailing arguments (after '--'), parse
them and print a report. The report will show how they relate to one another
with regards to dependencies and can print them in such an order that an earlier
module does not depend on any subsequent module.

By default any report will be preceded with a description of what the various
columns mean.
